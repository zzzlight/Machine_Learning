Before to start doing your practice work don't forget to join to the practice class 
in DingTalk to discuss the rules of the course.

Each link will be supported by a video lecture, its text, slides, practice 
task description and variants (when they will be needed).
Please, for each practice task read 'practice task desctiption.txt' carefully.

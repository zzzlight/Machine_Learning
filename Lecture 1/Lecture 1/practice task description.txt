The first practice task statement:
1. Install Python 3.7 and Anaconda (www.anaconda.com).
2. Try to open Jupiter notebook (ipynb-file) attached to this class.
3. Read notebook text and try to run code in it.
4. Individual task: 
	- Create your own Jupiter notebook
	- Write code that make this work:
		- Get your DingTalk number (write it manually to notebook) and split into sequence of three-digit numbers. The tail with one two-digit number should be discarded. For example for ID=12345678900 this code should return sequence [123, 456, 789].  
		- Convert this sequence of numbers into 3x3 numpy matrix A where each element of previous array is a row and one digit of each number is a column. For example, for this sequence [123, 456, 789] the matrix will be equal to [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
		- Read the NumPy documentation and compute the reversed matrix A (if you can reverse it), transposed matrix A, multiplication of matrix A and matrix A^(-1) or matrix A and transposed A, create a submatrix consists of the first and third rows of matrix A
	- Send your notebook to my email (avplatonov@itmo.ru) with subject "ML Course in HDU, first lab"

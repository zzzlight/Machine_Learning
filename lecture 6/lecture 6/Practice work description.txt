Practice work description

In the 6th lab you will continue to investigate scikit-learn library. In this practice work you will deal with 
probabilistic classification models in scikit-learn.

Variants for your practice work are placed in a directory 'variants' and xls-file contains the number of your variant.

Tasks statement:
1. Investigate features of your variant: 
- Draw histograms for features
- Draw scatter plot matrix of features. 
- Write comments about your investigation: what features are most useful for solving the problem and why, 
how features are distributed in the data.

4. Investigate the API of probabilistic models in scikit-learn and train models for your task. 
You need to try train Naive Bayess models and write your own model using Kernel Density estimation.
Please, use this articles as the starting point of your investigation:
	- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/density.html
	- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html

5. Estimate the results of training.
6. Try to change parameters of training, apply transformations to features or create new features to achieve better results.
7. Draw likelihood plot for you task and try to define outliers in the data.
8. Write a short report in your notebook about the results of the experiment.

Don't forget about the deadline for this work. You should send it before the evening of the nearest Tuesday (25.05 at 17:00 of Beijing).

Have a productive work!

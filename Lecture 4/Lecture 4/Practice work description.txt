Practice work description

In the 4th lab you will continue to investigate scikit-learn library. In this practice work you will deal with 
linear models in scikit-learn.

Variants for your practice work are placed in a directory 'variants' and xls-file contains the number of your variant.

Taks statement:
1. Investigate features of your variant: 
- Draw histograms for features
- For a classification task draw scatter plot matrix of features. For regression task try to analyze answer behavior 
on the plot of the feature values versus the answer of the regression model. 
- Write comments about your investigation: what features are most useful for solving the problem and why, 
how features are distributed in the data.
2. Read the article about linear models in scikit learn [linear_models.pdf]. This is a part of Scikit-Learn User Guide. If you want to
investigate this library or machine learning models more deeply, you could read the original textbook.
3. Investigate the API of linear models in scikit-learn and train a model for your task.
4. Estimate the results of training.
5. Try to change parameters of training to achieve better results.
6. Write a short report in your notebook about the results of the experiment.

Don't forget about the deadline for this work. You should send it before the evening of the nearest Friday (17.04 at 17:00 of Beijing).

Have a productive work!

P.S. Please, note that this week you will receive materials for the intermedia test. 
They will be sent after Thursday's consultation class. Your answer also should be sent before the deadline.

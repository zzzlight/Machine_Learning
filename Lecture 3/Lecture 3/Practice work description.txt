Practice work description

In the third lab you will continue to investigate scikit-learn library and you will learn how to use matplotlib 
to draw pretty plots for your notebooks. In this practice work you will deal with decision trees.

Variants for your practice work are placed in a directory 'variants' and xls-file contains the number of your variant.

Taks statement:
1. Please investigate examples of using matplotlib on these pages:
- https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html
- https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html

Also there is matplotlib guide in 3rd lab directory.

2. Investigate features of your variant: 
- Draw histograms for features
- For a classification task draw scatter plot matrix of features. For regression task try to analyze 
features behavior on feature-answer plots. 
- Write comment about your investigation: what features are most useful for solving the problem and why, 
how features are distributed in the data

3. Read a short article "dt_article.pdf" about decision trees in scikit-learn.
4. Investigate the API of decision trees in scikit-learn and train decision tree for your task.
5. Estimate your the result of training.
6. Try to change parameters of decision tree and analyze how they affect the quality of model.
7. Write a shor report in your notebook about the results of experiment.

Have a productive work!
